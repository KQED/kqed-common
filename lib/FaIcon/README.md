### Font-Awesome
Use the FaIcon component as a parent component to handle all Font-Awesome icons. We have an Icon folder located inside of FaIcon component which holds all our Font-Awesome icons. These are divided into two categories: solid and light. Please add the icons to these files respectively and append 'Solid' or 'Light' to the Icon file. For example: [Icon]Solid.js or [Icon]Light.js
